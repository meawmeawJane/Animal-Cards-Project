            <p class="funfact">The Australian Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States. The name of
                the breed is technically a misnomer, as it was developed in California in the 19th century, although
                it has its origins in Asturias, in the northwest of Spain; the breed was unknown in Australia at the
                time. It is claimed that Australian Shepherds descend from a variety of herding breeds, including
                collies imported, alongside sheep, from Australia and New Zealand; the breed reportedly took its
                name from this trade. Originally used solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become
                one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North America.</p>

            <p>At home the Australian Shepherd should have a well-fenced yard, though it is not generally an escape
                artist. The breed prefers fairly cool weather. Coat care consists of occasional bathing plus brushing at
                least once a week. However, during shedding season more frequent brushing is needed.</p>
